Scientific data
===============

.. objectives::

   - Get an overview of different formats for scientific data
   - Understand performance pitfalls when working with big data
   - Learn how to work with the HDF5 and NetCDF formats
   - Discuss the pros and cons of open science
   - Learn how to mint a DOI for your project   

Types of scientific data
------------------------

- CSV
- JSON
- HDF5
- NetCDF
- 



Sharing data
------------


The Open Science movement encourages researchers
to share research output beyond the contents of a
published academic article (and possibly supplementary information).

Pros and cons of sharing data (`from Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science>`__)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In favor:

- Open access publication of research reports and data allows for rigorous peer-review
- Science is publicly funded so all results of the research should be publicly available
- Open Science will make science more reproducible and transparent
- Open Science has more impact
- Open Science will help answer uniquely complex questions

Against:

- Too much unsorted information overwhelms scientists
- Potential misuse
- The public will misunderstand science data
- Increasing the scale of science will make verification of any discovery more difficult
- Low-quality science


FAIR principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"FAIR" is the current buzzword for data management. You may be asked
about it in, for example, making data management plans for grants:

- Findable
 
  - Will anyone else know that your data exists?
  - Solutions: put it in a standard repository, or at least a
    description of the data. Get a digital object identifier (DOI).

- Accessible

  - Once someone knows that the data exists, can they get it?
  - Usually solved by being in a repository, but for non-open data,
    may require more procedures.

- Interoperable

  - Is your data in a format that can be used by others, like csv
    instead of PDF?
  - Or better than csv. Example: `5-star open data <https://5stardata.info/en/>`__

- Reusable

  - Is there a license allowing others to re-use?

Even though this is usually referred to as "open data", it means
considering and making good decisions, even if non-open.

FAIR principles are usually discussed in the context of data,
but they apply also for research software.

Note that FAIR principles do not require data/software to be open.

.. discussion:: Discuss open science

   - Do you share any other research outputs besides published articles and possibly source code?
   - Discuss pros and cons of sharing research data.

 

Services for sharing and collaborating on research data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To find a research data repository for your data, you can search on the
`Registry of Research Data Repositories re3data <https://www.re3data.org/>`__
platform and filter by country, content type, discipline, etc.

**International:**

- `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`__: A general-purpose open access repository
  created by OpenAIRE and CERN. Integration with GitHub, allows
  researchers to upload files up to 50 GB.
- `Figshare <https://figshare.com/>`__: Online digital repository where researchers
  can preserve and share their research outputs (figures, datasets, images and videos).
  Users can make all of their research outputs available in a citable,
  shareable and discoverable manner.
- `EUDAT <https://eudat.eu>`__: European platform for researchers and practitioners from any research discipline to preserve, find, access, and process data in a trusted environment.
- `Dryad <https://datadryad.org/>`__: A general-purpose home for a wide diversity of datatypes,
  governed by a nonprofit membership organization.
  A curated resource that makes the data underlying scientific publications discoverable,
  freely reusable, and citable.
- `The Open Science Framework <https://osf.io/>`__: Gives free accounts for collaboration
  around files and other research artifacts. Each account can have up to 5 GB of files
  without any problem, and it remains private until you make it public.

**Sweden:**

- `ICOS for climate data <http://www.icos-sweden.se/>`__
- `Bolin center climate / geodata <https://bolin.su.se/data/>`__
- `NBIS for life science, sequence â€“omics data <https://nbis.se/infrastructure>`__


.. exercise:: (Optional) Get a DOI by connecting your repository to Zenodo

   Digital object identifiers (DOI) are the backbone of the academic
   reference and metrics system. In this exercise we will see how to
   make a GitHub repository citable by archiving it on the
   [Zenodo](http://about.zenodo.org/) archiving service. Zenodo is a
   general-purpose open access repository created by OpenAIRE and CERN.
   
   1. Sign in to Zenodo using your GitHub account. For this exercise, use the
      sandbox service: https://sandbox.zenodo.org/login/. This is a test version of the real Zenodo platform.
   2. Go to https://sandbox.zenodo.org/account/settings/github/.
   3. Find the repository you wish to publish, and flip the switch to ON.
   4. Go to GitHub and create a **release**  by clicking the `Create a new release` on the 
      right-hand side (a release is based on a Git tag, but is a higher-level GitHub feature).
   5. Creating a new release will trigger Zenodo into archiving your repository,
      and a DOI badge will be displayed next to your repository after a minute
      or two. You can include it in your GitHub README file: click the
      DOI badge and copy the relevant format (Markdown, RST, HTML).

   - Consider sharing other research outputs than articles.
