Introducing a toy problem
-------------------------

- 100,000 rows of observations for users of e.g. a social media platform or TV streaming service
- 20 columns with time measurements of hours spent per day, i.e. each column is a day
- want to add 21st column with slope of line fit to 20 observations
- need linear least squares fit to each of 100,000 rows
